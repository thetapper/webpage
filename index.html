                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Micah Wakefield, born and raised in Denver CO and now I'm currently studying Computer Science, Music, and Theatre at Calvin University.</p>
                   <p> As I pursue my education, I'm fascinated by how differently these fields evolve. Computer science transforms at breakneck speed—new frameworks, tools, and technologies emerge constantly, making it both thrilling and challenging to stay current. Theatre, on the other hand, holds onto its traditions even as it cautiously embraces new technology. There's something beautiful about that tension between innovation and preservation.
                    I'm passionate about both technology and the performing arts, and I'm excited to contribute positively to both. I find my self driven by the same goal for both fields: to have a positive impact on the world.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here you'll find a collection of my work spanning both computer science and theatre. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!</p>
